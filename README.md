Designing software involves many different approaches. It’s important to me to start by coming up with an initial design and then refining the design as necessary. A skill used while working on my project was taking designs from my previous work and continuing to develop them into the project. Leading up to my project I implemented and refined my designs to my scene until reaching the expected output. In future work, I would like to find a good balance of the amount of design planned up front and the amount incorporated during implementation.

Developing programs revolves around strategic plans. Some strategies used while working with my 3D scene involved having a strategic vision of the scene I looked to create while keeping the guidelines expected in mind. Throughout my program I’ve learned the importance of iteration in development. I used this process methodology by working to grasp resources and output expected assignments through each module which led to the make-up of my final project.

Computer science is an important field as computers and technology are integrated in many fields in our modern economy. With computational graphics and visualizations, the development lifecycle is key and working through the processes learned in the course will help me on my educational pathway as I work towards future projects. The knowledge gained from this course can open doors to fields that I once didn’t seek while also helping me to support team projects that involve aspects learned.
